"""Interrupt a ComfyUI render before this box heat soaks itself into a power cut.

This machine drops power, with nothing in the kernel log, when it is held hot
for long enough. The run that killed it on 2026-09-01 is sampled minute by
minute in ~/h3-calib-hw.log, and the shape is the point:

    minute   gpu avg  gpu max  zone avg  zone max
         3      68.0       79      76.9        86
         4      79.3       84      88.4        91
         5      81.5       85      91.0        93
        ...      ...      ...       ...       ...
        11      81.0       85      91.7        92   <- power cut at 11:06

It reached its plateau by minute four or five and then sat there. It did not
keep climbing into the cut; it soaked at roughly GPU 82 to 86 and zone 91 to 94
for seven minutes and then died. So an instantaneous threshold is the wrong
instrument: that plateau is simply where any long render lives, and tripping on
it kills healthy runs (an 864x480 render was interrupted at 83 C doing nothing
unusual).

What is measured is time spent hot. This trips on a soak budget instead: how
long the hottest thermal zone has been at or above a threshold, continuously.
The fatal run had 417 s of it; the budget here is 240 s, which would have fired
three minutes before the cut. Two instantaneous ceilings sit above the observed
plateau as a backstop for a faster ramp than the one on record.

Losing a render beats losing the box.
